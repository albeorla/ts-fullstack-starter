## ‚öôÔ∏è Local E2E Setup

Prepare the repository for Playwright tests using the provided setup script:

```bash
# Install browsers, generate Prisma client, and seed the database
./scripts/setup-tests.sh

# Then run the CI mode tests
yarn test:e2e:ci
```

This script requires internet access to download Playwright browsers.

## How do I deploy this?

Follow our deployment guides for [Vercel](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel), [Netlify](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/netlify) and [Docker](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/docker) for more information.

## üê≥ Docker Support

### Development with Docker
```bash
# Run development environment with hot reload
docker compose up

# Run in detached mode
docker compose up -d
```

### E2E Testing with Docker
Run the Playwright test suite inside Docker with a bundled PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# Run E2E tests in Docker (uses .env.test)
yarn test:e2e:docker

# Or manually with docker compose
docker compose up --build --exit-code-from e2e e2e

# View test results
ls -la playwright-report/
ls -la test-results/
```

The `docker/docker-compose.yml` file provisions a `postgres:15` container and a test runner image based on the official Playwright image, ensuring consistent results locally and in CI.

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Stop all containers
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down

# Remove volumes (clean database)
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f [service_name]

# Build without cache
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache
```

Our GitHub Actions workflow uses the same command to run E2E tests in the pipeline.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD
See the optimized workflow in .github/workflows/ci-optimized.yml for change detection, caching, and E2E testing with Docker.
