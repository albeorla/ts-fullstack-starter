## ‚öôÔ∏è Local E2E Setup

Prepare the repository for Playwright tests using the provided setup script:

```bash
# Install browsers, generate Prisma client, and seed the database
./setup-tests.sh

# Then run the CI mode tests
yarn test:e2e:ci
```

This script requires internet access to download Playwright browsers.

## How do I deploy this?

Follow our deployment guides for [Vercel](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel), [Netlify](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/netlify) and [Docker](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/docker) for more information.

## üê≥ Docker E2E Testing

Run the Playwright test suite inside Docker with a bundled PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# Build services and run tests
docker-compose up --build --exit-code-from e2e e2e
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file provisions a `postgres:15` container and a test runner image based on the official Playwright image, ensuring consistent results locally and in CI.

Our GitHub Actions workflow uses the same command to run E2E tests in the pipeline.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD
See the optimized workflow in .github/workflows/ci-optimized.yml for change detection, caching, and E2E testing with Docker.
